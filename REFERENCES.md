# Sanger Reference Files

Alignment for both the RNA and DNA samples was first performed in-house.

## RNA Sequencing

Pre-build in-house references are used to align the FASTQ data to GRCh37. Details on these can be found [here](https://github.com/cancerit/cgpRna/wiki/1.1-Prepare-mapping-and-QC-reference-data#pre-generated-data).

## DNA Sequencing

The necessary files for building the analysis reference can be found [here](https://github.com/cancerit/dockstore-cgpwxs/blob/develop/examples/cgpwxs/bam_csi.json).
